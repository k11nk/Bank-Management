1. Initial Goals and Planning
1.1 Objective:

Goal: Create a console-based Bank Management System with distinct interfaces for administrators and users. Administrators can manage all accounts and perform CRUD operations, while users can interact with their specific accounts for transactions.
1.2 Requirements:

Admin Features: Create, read, update, delete accounts, and manage transactions for all accounts.
User Features: Access their own accounts for deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries.
Persistence: Save and load account data from a file.
2. System Design
2.1 Architecture:

Classes:
Account: Represents an individual bank account.
Bank: Manages all account operations and user interactions.
File Handling: Store account details in a text file (accounts.txt), which ensures data persistence across sessions.
3. Step-by-Step Development
3.1 Design the Account Class:

Attributes:
accountNumber: Unique identifier for the account.
name: Name of the account holder.
balance: Current balance of the account.
password: For user authentication.
Methods:
serialize(): Convert account data to a string format for file storage.
deserialize(): Convert a string back to an Account object.
authenticate(): Verify the user’s password.
3.2 Design the Bank Class:

Attributes:
accounts: A vector to store all account objects.
availableAccountNumbers: A set to keep track of reusable account numbers.
nextAccountNumber: The next available account number.
Methods:
Admin Operations:
adminMenu(): Provides a menu for admin operations.
Methods for creating, showing, searching, deleting accounts, and managing transactions.
User Operations:
userMenu(): Provides a menu for user operations.
Methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking balance in the user's own account.
File Operations:
loadAccounts(): Load account data from a file into memory.
saveAccounts(): Save account data from memory to a file.
Utility Methods:
clearInputBuffer(): Ensure clean input handling.
3.3 Implementation Details:

Input Handling: Implement robust input validation to handle user errors
and edge cases, ensuring that all inputs are correctly processed.
Password Management: Use a simple password check for authentication.
Account Number Reuse: Maintain a set of available account numbers to handle account deletions and reuse.
4. Key Challenges and Solutions
4.1 Handling Input and Output:

Challenge: Ensuring smooth interaction between user inputs and program responses.
Solution: Implement clearInputBuffer() to manage input issues, and use cin.clear() and cin.ignore() to handle erroneous inputs gracefully.
4.2 File Management:

Challenge: Ensuring data consistency and persistence across sessions.
Solution: Use ifstream and ofstream for reading from and writing to files, and handle exceptions to ensure robust file operations.
4.3 Authentication and Security:

Challenge: Ensuring secure access to accounts.
Solution: Simple password checks are used; future enhancements could include encrypted password storage.
4.4 Admin vs. User Access:

Challenge: Differentiating access levels between admin and user functionalities.
Solution: Separate menu options and functionalities based on the user’s role, ensuring users only interact with their own accounts while admins have full access.
5. Testing and Validation
5.1 Unit Testing:

Test individual methods in the Account and Bank classes for correctness.
Validate serialization and deserialization to ensure accurate file storage and retrieval.
5.2 Integration Testing:

Test the interaction between different parts of the system (e.g., account creation and transaction handling).
Ensure that file operations do not interfere with the application’s functionality.
5.3 User Testing:

Conduct testing with real users to gather feedback on usability and to identify any issues with the menu navigation or input handling.
6. Future Improvements
6.1 GUI Implementation:

Consider developing a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance user experience.
6.2 Enhanced Security:

Implement encryption for password storage and improve authentication mechanisms.
6.3 Additional Features:

Add functionalities like account transfers, transaction history, and interest calculations.
7. Conclusion
Summary: The Bank Management System project was developed with the goal of providing a functional and user-friendly console application for managing bank accounts. The project was built in a structured manner, starting from class design and method implementation to handling real-world challenges like file management and user input. Future improvements are planned to enhance the system's usability and security.
